    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My programming journey began with computer security, sparking 
      a curiosity that grew into something broader: seeing problems 
      from both technical and human angles. Over the years, I've put 
      this approach to work across general IT, healthcare IT, software 
      development, and architecture roles. I love learning new systems 
      and technologies, but I'm equally interested in understanding the 
      people who use them. This combination helps me build solutions 
      that work well in the real world.
