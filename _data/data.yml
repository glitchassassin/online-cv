    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I've been interested in computer security since I was young and first
      discovering what I could do with computer programming. I've never lost
      that passion, working to expand my security skillset in my free time while
      I gained a broad base of IT & healthcare knowledge in various related positions.
      My goal is to move into the information security space full time in a blue team/
      incident response-type position.
